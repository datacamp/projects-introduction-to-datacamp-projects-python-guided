  This is an introduction to DataCamp projects. DataCamp projects allow you to apply 
  the skills you have learned in DataCamp courses. In each project, you will carry out 
  an end-to-end analysis on real-world tasks using real-world tools and workflows.
  
  In doing so, you will learn how to work with Jupyter notebooks: an open-source web 
  application that is great for interactive data analysis.
